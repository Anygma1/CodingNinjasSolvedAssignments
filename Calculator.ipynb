    "Write a program that works as a simple calculator. It reads an integer for choice.\n",
    "1. If the choice is 1, 2 integers are taken for input and their sum is printed.\n",
    "2. If the choice is 2, 2 integers are taken for input and their difference is printed.\n",
    "3. If  the choice is 3, 2 integers are taken for input and their product is printed.\n",
